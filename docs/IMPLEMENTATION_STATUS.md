# Implementation Status

## Runnable now
Frontend, local API, image analysis, webcam stream, pose landmarks, person segmentation, face detection, normalized body geometry, hardware telemetry.

## Prototype only
Canvas clothing overlay, fabric visual effects, body transformation UI, salon previews, preference/demo flows.

## Not implemented
Metric anthropometry, biometric identity, production VTON, production hair synthesis, demographics/emotion inference, persistence, queue/worker, iMonitor catalog adapter.

## Acceptance rule
Do not move an item to runnable/completed until it has real code, clean-clone installation instructions and a reproducible test.

## Cameras
- RUNNABLE: laptop/standard USB RGB webcam
- PLANNED: camera-provider abstraction and device selection
- PLANNED: Xbox One Kinect / Kinect v2 RGB-D provider via Microsoft Kinect for Windows SDK 2.0
- PLANNED: generic RGB-D provider contract for additional cameras
- RULE: Kinect/RGB-D dependencies must remain optional and must not break RGB-only installation.
